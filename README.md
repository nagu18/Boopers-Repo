# 💥 Bloopers – My Project Bug's & Recovery Notes

This is my personal archive of bloopers — unexpected bugs, failed experiments, broken setups, and everything else that didn’t go as planned during my tech journey.

Whenever I hit a wall or mess something up (and later forget the fix 😅), I log it here. Each blooper tells a story — of trial, error, and (hopefully) learning.

## 🚧 Why This Repo?

In every project, mistakes happen. Some are small. Some crash everything. This repo helps me:
- Keep track of what went wrong and how I (hopefully) fixed it
- Avoid making the same mistake twice
- Reflect on how far I’ve come
- Share a little fun and chaos from behind the scenes

## 📁 What's Inside?

- Real-world mistakes from my projects
- Logs of errors and bugs
- Notes on root causes and fixes
- Screenshots (when available)
- Honest moments of “what was I thinking?”

## 🧠 What You'll Learn (If You Read This)

You’ll see that every failure is part of the process. Whether you’re learning networking, coding, OS-level tweaks, or systems design — this repo proves that trial and error is how real growth happens.

## 📝 Blooper Format

Each entry usually includes:
- **Date**
- **Summary**
- **Problem**
- **Mistake or Misstep**
- **Fix or Workaround**
- **What I Learned**
- **(Optional)** Screenshot or command logs

> This repo is not just for documenting failure — it’s about making it part of the story.
